    <h3 class="project-description">
      This project aims to determine the best-performing team in the NBA, using
      the total number of wins as the comparison metric from 2003 to 2021. Three
      visualizations will be provided. The first one describes the overall
      performance and rankings of all teams. The second one describes the
      winning and losing relationships between teams. The last chart traces the
      performance of the best and worst teams throughout time.

    <h4>
      This chart describes the total wins in each state and the overall team
      rankings among all NBA teams. The darker the color, the more home wins
      there are in that state. Using this table, we can identify the teams with
      the most wins from the 2003-04 season to the 2020-21 season. When you
      hover your mouse over the chart, you can see the ranking of each team in
      the league. Since the Spurs rank 1st place and the Knicks rank 30th place,
      we will analyze these two teams further in the third chart.

    <h4>
      This chart visualizes the winning and losing relationships between
      different teams. The orange line represents a winning relationship, and
      gray represents a losing relationship. For example, if there is an orange
      arrow starting from the Spurs to the Wizards, it means the Spurs have the
      highest winning percentage against the Wizards. The same logic applies to
      the gray line. To make the chart clear, you can click the buttons to show
      only winning or losing relationships.

      This bar chart traces the performance of the best-performing team (with
      the most game wins) and the worst team over time. When you hover your
      mouse over the graph, the difference in wins will be displayed. As
      mentioned in the first chart, we will analyze the Spurs and Knicks. By
      displaying their wins for each year, we can directly observe the
      exceptional performance of the Spurs.

      In conclusion, the visualizations provide clear evidence that the San
      Antonio Spurs are the dominant team in the league. Their highest number of
      wins and winning rate against other teams, including the Magic, Celtics,
      Hornets, Kings, Clippers, and Mavericks, solidify their status as the best
      team. The comparison between the Spurs and the Knicks reveals a
      significant gap in performance. The Spurs' success is not surprising
      considering their exceptional leadership under head coach Gregg Popovich,
      widely recognized as one of the greatest coaches in NBA history.
      Additionally, the presence of legendary players such as Tim Duncan, Tony
      Parker, and Manu Ginobili, along with the organization's strong personnel,
      have contributed to the Spurs' status as the top team in the NBA.
